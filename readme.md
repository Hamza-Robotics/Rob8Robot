# GazeBot Control Code

This repository contains the code required to control the GazeBot, an eye-controlled robot. The project involves eye tracking using a GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) and intention estimation. For the eye tracking GRU and intention estimation, refer to the [rob8_main_processing](https://github.com/decamargo10/rob8_main_processing) repository.

## Setup and Usage

To run this code, follow the steps below:

1. **Clone and Source the Repository:**
   - Clone this repository to your local machine.
   - Source the repository to make the code accessible.

2. **Run Eye Tracking Program:**
   - Run the eye tracking program on another PC. Refer to the [rob8_main_processing](https://github.com/decamargo10/rob8_main_processing) repository for details on setting up eye tracking.

3. **Launch Intention Package:**
   - Run the following command to launch the intention package:
     ```bash
     roslaunch intention_application startapplication.launch
     ```
     This launch file (`startapplication.launch`) orchestrates various components, including camera transforms, Pose estimation of the human, MoveIt for motion planning, image processing, and TCP client communication with the other PC.
