Contains code needed to control the gazebot. Gazebot is an eye controlled robot.

For the eye tracking and intention estimation see: https://github.com/decamargo10/rob8_main_processing


To run this code:

1. Clone the repository and source it.
2. Run the eye tracking program on the other pc. 
3. Run the roslaunch file in the intention package: startapplication.launch


You need to install the UR driver and your camera driver and you need to change the launch file to accomodate those changes.

There is a hand eye calibration module for the hand eye calibration.
